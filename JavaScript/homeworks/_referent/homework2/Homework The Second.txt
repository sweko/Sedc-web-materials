Description:
Our user has a grocery store, and needs a web-powered receipt generator. Fortunately, he never changes the prices of his items, or the items he sells. Also fortunately, he is near a wholesale distributor, so he always has an up to date inventory of 100 items of each product he sells. Help him make a web-powered receipt generator, so he can show off to potential investors.

Details:
Make a web-page (and a javascript program) with the following functionalities:
1. It should have one entry box for every product the grocer sells
2. It should accept only integer values in the 1-100 range. [*]
3. It should have a button to finish the receipt entry
4. When the button is pressed it should show a receipt in a specified format [**]
5. The prices will be given with [***]
	var prices = [50, 75, 125, 70, 40, 60];
6. The product list is given with [***]
	var products = ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Pears', 'Lemons', 'Melons', 'Bananas'];
7. The code should have a separate function called "calculateReceipt" that receives an array of integers, and returns another array of product prices, along with a grand total [****]

[*] Both a validated text input or a select box are fine
[**] Don't worry about printing, only showing the receipt is enough for now
[***] Feel free to add your own products or prices, the program should work with any price/product list
[****] This means that the result array will have one more element than the entry array

Example:
If the entry array is 
	var shoppingList = [5, 0, 3, 4, 0, 3];
which means that the customer bought, 5 apples, 0 oranges, 3 pears, 4 lemons, 0 melons and 3 bananas, the receipt should look like this:

You bought
 5 Apples  =  250
 3 Pears   =  375
 4 Lemons  = 280
 3 Bananas = 180
----------------
  Total = 1085

(The exact formatting of the output text will not be tested, you don't have to align the numbers)

This homework is valid for both groups

Good Luck,
SW
